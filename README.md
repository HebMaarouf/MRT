Installation
To get started with the table component in your React project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository (or create your own project if it's a new table component):

```powershell
git clone <repo-url>

Navigate into the project directory:

 ```powershell
cd my-table-project

Install required dependencies:

Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then run:

 ```powershell
npm install

Run the development server:

By default, Vite will run the server on port 5173:

 ```powershell
npm run dev

Access the project in your browser:

Open http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port) 

Note: This is a simple example, but you can extend it to create a more advanced, fully featured table. You can add functionalities like row deletion, creating new rows, fetching data from a server, displaying loading and fetching states, and much more. Experiment with it, and you will discover even more possibilities!
